                            <p>My career goal is to become an actor/singer. My plan on achieving these goals is to work hard, to practice getting to my goals, and get good grades. This is my goal because I love to watch tv and I want to bring kids and adults the same happiness tv brought me. 

                                Some traits that can help me with these careers that I have are perseverance, ambition, cheery, humorous, friendly helpful, and honest. I persevere when I have hard school work, I have ambition when I get a project and want to finish it. I am also cheery because all my friends say that I am happy and kind all the time. I am humorous because I make my whole family and friends laugh, and all my friends think I am friendly. Also, I am helpful and honest if someone in my family is hurt (physically or mentally) and help them cheer up.
                                
                                Some achievements that I have been going up till orange belt while learning self-defense, getting honor roll every quarter, and getting an award in 5th grade for being persistent. I have learned from my experiences that you donâ€™t know what things are like until you try them. One time I was scared for something but once I tried it, I loved doing that thing. 
                                
                                Anyways thank you for reading my goals on what to be when i grow up and why!
